# Approaching the Edge

## High Concept
- This game allows players to communicate with dfferent character, and by choosing different conversation, players can get to different ends.
- Players are able to go to different places, and by watching different events, they are also able to get to different ends

## Genre
- Interactive fiction

## Platform
- desktop only

## Story
- This is a story happens with a group of people in a small village, only one people gets the chance to get out from this village, people votes to decide who doesn't get that chance. With the story going on, a huge secret of this village is being shown.
- It will be a little sceary in the beginning of the game, but when the game goes on, it will be put into a totally different mood
- When players finish different conversations and different actions, they will know the story as a whole.
- Choices in a conversation and players' choices when facing different events will drive the plot
- In order to accomplish the game, players need to walk through all conversations and all ends. (This is the motivation)

## Esthetics
- graphics style: cartoonish (I will draw it myself, and I'm not godd at drawing, but I will try my best!)
- sound: ambient music, and it will loop
- when clicking the start button, there will be a sound

## Gameplay
- players are able to click on different choices when doing conversations with characters, each choice may lead to different end

- when in a room, players can search the room, and they can put different stuff (which they collected from other rooms or from different characters) on the same sopt, but each stuff will lead to different ends.

- The control is clicking by the mouse.

- There will be no teaching part on the conversation part, but in the first room, there will be a pretty obvious sign to show how drag stuff, and drop them
- There is not much they need to learn on "how to play the game", beacuse everything is simple. However, if players know something about eastern culture, it will be easier for them to understand the background of the story.
